# Dev Divas Dictionary App

## The Project

Our goal was to create a real-world dictionary web app according to the guidelines presented by [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL). The user can:
- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
